# Self-Driving Car Project Overview - Setup and Implementation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the Self-Driving Car Project Overview application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Step 1: Project Setup

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new React project with TypeScript:
   ```
   npx create-react-app self-driving-car-overview --template typescript
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd self-driving-car-overview
   ```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages:

```
npm install lucide-react tailwindcss @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

1. Initialize Tailwind CSS:
   ```
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```
2. Open `tailwind.config.js` and replace its content with:
   ```javascript
   /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```
3. Open `src/index.css` and add the following at the top:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

## Step 4: Create Components

In the `src` folder, create a new folder called `components`. Inside it, create the following files:

1. `SelfDrivingCarOverview.tsx`
2. `ProjectStructure.tsx`
3. `MindMap.tsx`
4. `ArchitectureDiagram.tsx`
5. `ProjectOverview.tsx`

## Step 5: Implement Components

Copy and paste the provided code for each component into its respective file. Ensure you're using the latest versions we've developed, which include the improvements for visibility and layout.

## Step 6: Update App.tsx

Replace the content of `src/App.tsx` with:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import SelfDrivingCarOverview from './components/SelfDrivingCarOverview';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App bg-gray-100 min-h-screen py-8">
      <SelfDrivingCarOverview />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 7: Run the Application

1. In the terminal, make sure you're in the project root directory.
2. Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now see the Self-Driving Car Project Overview application running in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
2. Check for any console errors in your browser's developer tools.
3. Verify that all component files are in the correct location and named correctly.
4. Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly configured.

## Additional Notes

- The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. If you want to customize the appearance, you can modify the Tailwind classes in the component files.
- The SVG diagrams (MindMap and ArchitectureDiagram) can be further customized by adjusting the SVG code in their respective component files.
- To add or modify content, update the respective component files (e.g., ProjectOverview.tsx for the project overview text).

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Self-Driving Car Project Overview application running locally on your machine. The application includes interactive tabs for Project Structure, Mind Map, Architecture Diagram, and Project Overview, providing a comprehensive visualization of the self-driving car project structure and components.
